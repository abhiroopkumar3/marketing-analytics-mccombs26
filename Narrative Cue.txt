“Using sample of the 2024 Stack Overflow survey data, I built a regression model, which predicted, on average, within $39K of the actual reported values — acceptable accuracy considering the variability across global compensation data.”

“The model explains roughly 25% of salary variation — typical for compensation data — indicating that the included variables captures key pay drivers — experience, organization size, AI engagement, python usability — but salaries remain partly unpredictable due to many human and market factors.”
